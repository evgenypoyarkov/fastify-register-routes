const fastify = Fastify()

const opts = {
  regex: /((Route)|(Routes))\.js|.mjs$/,
  showTable: true
}

// path with your's routes files
const defaultPath = path.join(__dirname, './routes')

registerRoutes(fastify, defaultPath, opts)

// case need confering routes registred's
// fastify provide an log with the routes loaded
// this function ready Ã© executed after the all is completed loading
fastify.ready().then(() => console.log(fastify.printRoutes()))

fastify.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', err => {
  if (err) {
